    <h4>Where It All Began</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Duncan">Tim Duncan</a> is the son of Ione, a midwife, and William
        Duncan, a mason. He has two older sisters, Cheryl and Tricia, and one older brother, Scott, a director and
        cinematographer. He was born and
        raised on Saint Croix, one of the main islands composing the U.S. Virgin Islands. In school, Duncan was a
        bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like his sister Tricia.His parents were very
        supportive and Duncan excelled at swimming,
        becoming a teenage standout in the 50, 100 and 400 meters freestyle and aiming to make the 1992 Olympic Games
        as a member of the United States Team. When Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming
        pool in 1989, Duncan was forced
        to swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was
        dealt another emotional blow when his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and died one day before his 14th
        birthday. In her last days,
        she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's
        refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law
        to turn to basketball.

        Duncan initially had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration.
        Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: "[Duncan] was so huge. So
        big and tall, but he was awfully
        awkward at the time."He overcame this to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School,
        averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities, despite
        having only picked up the game in ninth
        grade. Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom in particular grew interested in Duncan after the
        16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching
        for a tall, physical player to
        play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at
        first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for
        most of the conversation.
        However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and
        discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner. Eventually, despite
        scholarship offers by the University of Hartford,
        the University of Delaware and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

    <h4>Wake Forest University (1993–1997)</h4>
    <p>
        In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady or Kobe
        Bryant, Duncan stayed at college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the
        Year, and a three-time NABC Defensive
        Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team
        between 1995 and 1997, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the
        year where he led the conference
        in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference
        history to lead all four of those categories. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and
        finished his college career as the all-time
        leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). He remains one of
        only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He was also the first player in
        NCAA history to reach 1,500
        points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 blocked shots and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker
        in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle and third on the
        ACC career rebounding list
        with 1,570 rebounds. After earning his college degree, Duncan became automatically eligible for the 1997 NBA
        Draft
